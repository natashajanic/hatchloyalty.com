Over the past 12 months, we’ve surveyed the convenience and fuel landscape with current and potential customers.  We’ve asked questions and we’ve listened.

From these conversations, we asked ourselves:  How do current technology and industry practices help the retailer?

One finding was clear. Cents off fuel is a very popular strategy for driving loyalty in convenience and fuel.

**The logic goes something like this...**

Convenience retailers sell 80% of the gasoline nationwide.  Fuel drives foot traffic.  Retail operators benefit from foot traffic.  So why not give consumers a break on gas price to drive traffic?  There’s a high perceived value for 5 cents off per gallon.  If customers get hooked on the discount, they’ll come back and the convenience retailer will become the retailer of choice.

It seems like a compelling argument, but we believe convenience retailers have a much bigger opportunity.

**Here's why...**

Programs that **_only_** offer cents off fuel are limited.  They won’t drive profitability long-term and will limit the ability of the retailer to change customer behavior.  Program design for any loyalty program is all about strategy.  What behaviors are you trying to encourage?

The system of rewards and penalties created by just ‘cents off’ is not aligned with enhancing the customer experience or profitability for the c-store.

### 'Just' Cents Off = An Entitlement Program That Puts Your Brand at Risk
‘Cents off’ trains the customer to make fuel decisions based on price and makes brands more vulnerable to price competition from other retailers. If you build the cost of cents off as a tax into your fuel cost, you’re training customers to leave you for lower prices elsewhere.

In addition, while we believe cents off is a great strategy to promote acquisition into a program, it’s nearly impossible to take the benefit away.  It becomes a social contract and it puts your brand at risk when you inevitably want to evolve your strategy.  It becomes a guaranteed cost center for the long-term, reducing margin at the pump and diluting the benefit of low cost payment initiatives like ACH and co-branded credit.

### Losing 60-70% of Customers to 'Pump and Run' is a Missed Opportunity
In-store conversion represents the largest margin opportunity in the industry, but ‘cents off’ doesn’t drive people to make a purchase in-store.  If your retail site strictly uses ‘Cents off’, what are your options to encourage behavior outside of more frequent fuel trips?  More ‘cents off?’  That’s probably not a sustainable strategy.

If rewards and offers are a currency you use to influence behavior, they should be continually adapted to drive ROI.  Best-in-class programs outside of c-store and fuel don’t offer static rewards or offers on one product.  They use their knowledge about customer behavior to continually adapt, with the goal of driving new behavior.

Your technology and program design should give you flexibility to pull multiple levers to drive more profitable customer behavior.  It should allow you to continually test targeted and personalized marketing.  It should support your strategy to convert more customers and drive in-store purchase behavior on your terms.

### A Path Forward
‘Cents off’ can be a compelling part of any program.  However, it’s best reserved for specific use cases such as a reward, or an acquisition vehicle for membership; not a static entitlement benefit.

Save the margin that you lose on fuel-only discounts by promoting your most profitable asset: merchandise inside the store.  Retailers that can drive customer engagement beyond the fuel pump reduce the risk of losing customers to competitors solely on price, and will create long-term brand loyalty across fuel and retail merchandise. Our partners believe in this approach, and we’re providing the connective technology to help effectively execute this strategy.
