## Breaking through the clutter of multiple devices to identify, target and delight customers through the right channel, at the right time

When you hear people-based marketing, you may think to yourself, “isn’t all marketing people-based?” While the goal is to get an individual to behave or think in a certain way, often times, the way in which the message is delivered is based on other factors such as the channel (mobile, web, etc.) or personas built around the limited data available. With more focused targeting opportunities offered by platforms such as Facebook and Google, marketers have shifted from personas to personalization.

Consumers have more ways to transact and consume media than ever before. They have less brand loyalty, but expect more personalized experiences from the brands they interact with. Targeting solely based on devices is often an oversimplified view of the customer. Deliver meaningful experiences throughout the customer lifecycle and across relevant channels.

### People Are Complicated

Humans are constantly changing and evolving. Preferences and behaviors can vary throughout a single day, but many retailers and marketers have a difficult time keeping pace. Many marketers must rely on third-party data sources (data that comes from outside of the retailer or is purchased) that often creates a fragmented view of the customer by attempting to string together bits and pieces of information from multiple sources. This results in an approximation of who the customer is, but doesn’t account for the nuanced and sometimes, random, changes in behavior.

### Data, Data and More Data

In order to deliver delightful experiences that enhance brand loyalty, data must be accessed and acted upon in real-time. This requires first-party data, or data that the brand or retailer owns. Many retailers have hopped on the data train, with 86% of marketers increasing their spend on first-party data in 2016. Imagine the possibility of knowing what a customer wants or needs at a given moment, pairing that with location-based data, and delivering a truly powerful and personalized message.

### Multiple Identities

Even with access to first-party data, unless there’s a way to tag customers with unique identifiers across interactions, there is no way to map the entire customer journey accurately. Luckily, a customer engagement program can provide an ID to customers that can be used to track their preferences and behaviors. According to Forrester, this consolidation is called “Identity Resolution,” and is key in understanding that customers are people, not devices. A loyalty or engagement program is a great way to assign that ID to a customer and track their interactions with a brand or retailer across channels and devices.

### Privacy, Please

One of the biggest barriers to actually aggregating first-party data is data privacy. Because the data collected can be quite personal, consumers are more hesitant to share that with just anyone. Beyond that, they understand their data is valuable and expect something in return for sharing it with brands and retailers. This is where a customer engagement program can really help break down the privacy wall. If a customer perceives that they are getting personalized messaging and offers in return for sharing their data, their willingness to identify themselves and allow brands and retailers to track their behavior increases.

Delivering delightful, personalized experiences is key in people-based marketing. It relies on first-party, real-time data access and activation. Only through the insights gleaned from that data, can brands and retailers most effectively target their customers.
