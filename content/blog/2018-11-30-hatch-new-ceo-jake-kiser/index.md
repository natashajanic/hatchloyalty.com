Jake Kiser will lead Hatch as it continues its focus on being the leading customer activation engine for enterprise retailers. He will replace outgoing CEO, Dan Gloede, who successfully led the Hatch team as it completed an important transition from SMB to enterprise loyalty, preparing the company for long term growth.

“Now is the perfect time for Jake to step into this leadership role, and the Board is confident that he will help deliver on the promise we all see,” said Dan Gloede. “Jake is a thoughtful, innovative thinker with passion for the team, our product and our clients.”

Originally joining the company in 2013 to expand its enterprise offering, Jake led the development and growth of Hatch and will now lead the next wave of growth for the Andreessen Horowitz and Lightbank backed company.

“I’m excited for the challenge, excited for the team and honored to work closely with so many talented people, said Jake Kiser.”
