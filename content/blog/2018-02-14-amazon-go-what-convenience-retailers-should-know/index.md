Amazon recently unveiled in shiny, new, cashier-less toy/convenience store: Amazon Go. Seeking to disrupt the convenience store space, Amazon Go allows customers to identify themselves with the app, pick up their items and walk right out. Through Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology, customers’ Amazon accounts are billed for their purchase when they exit the store. No wait. No line. No hassle. 

Between Amazon Books, Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 and now Amazon Go,  it’s clear Amazon sees tremendous value beyond being an ecommerce giant. However, will this new store concept turn retail on its head, just as Amazon turned ecommerce on its head?

Amazon’s ‘Just Walk Out’ shopping experience far surpasses the technological advances across retail, even more so in the convenience space where legacy and proprietary hardware make it [difficult to implement](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/blog/personalizing-convenience-how-technology-is-transforming-the-fuel-convenience-store-industry/) new technology. While many convenience retailers are beginning to embrace [API- and cloud-based technology](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/blog/how-open-architecture-and-apis-are-changing-convenience-retail/) that enable richer customer experiences, it will be a long while before technology similar to Amazon’s will be available across retail ([if it ever is](http://www.cspdailynews.com/industry-news-analysis/technology/articles/peek-inside-amazon-go#page=1)).

Achieving a Just Walk Out shopping experience across convenience retail isn’t something that must be accomplished in the immediate future, but there are valuable takeaways from Amazon’s approach to convenience.

## Streamlined Customer Experience

Perhaps the most valuable takeaway is Amazon’s inherent ability to deliver optimal customer experiences, taking insights gleaned from ecommerce and applying them to physical retail. From 1-Click checkout to Dash Buttons, Amazon created a frictionless online shopping experience that also drives their bottom line. It’s estimated that 1-Click checkout generated an additional [$2.4 billion](http://rejoiner.com/resources/amazon-1clickpatent/) in annual revenue. Translating that to the in-store experience can streamline one of the biggest pain points of the physical retail experience: waiting in the check out line. 

When ease and convenience are the cornerstones of fuel & convenience stores, Amazon seems to be getting something right. What convenience retailers can learn from Amazon’s approach is a focus on embracing changing [consumer expectations](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/blog/customer-engagement-trends-2018-the-age-of-the-consumer/) and optimizing accordingly. While Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology won’t be readily available for retailers, and isn’t even necessary in the immediate future, convenience stores can adopt other methods to streamline the customer experience.

Loyalty programs that incorporate both in-store merchandise and fuel discounts, and mobile payments are great ways to create a cohesive, frictionless customer experience that will keep customers coming back. 

### Drive Customers In-Store

One of the biggest challenges in the fuel & convenience store industry is converting customers from the pump to the store, with only [35% of fuel customers](http://www.cspdailynews.com/category-news/services/articles/convert-more-fuel-stops-store-visits) stepping foot inside of the store. With the highest margin items being in-store merchandise, this is a huge [missed opportunity](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/blog/loyalty-cents-off/) for fuel & convenience retailers. While there are many factors that go into improving this conversion rate, retailers must first consider the customer’s purpose for visiting their business. 

It’s likely that the customer is en route to their destination and needs to stop for gas. Maybe your business is their favorite and they drive a little out of their way. That customer expects to quickly and conveniently fill their tank. If they do visit the store, they expect the same ease and speed they experience at the pump. By adopting Amazon’s approach to a streamlined in-store experience, convenience retailers can expect to increase the fuel-to-store conversion rate. If a customer knows that your brand delivers a smooth, enjoyable in-store experience, they’re more likely to walk the additional 8-10 feet from the pump to your store.

### Fresh Food Frenzy

As consumer preferences pivot toward healthier food options, more convenience retailers are mixing up their merchandise to accommodate. Amazon emphasizes the importance and preference for fresh food with [30% of its product offerings](http://www.cspdailynews.com/industry-news-analysis/technology/articles/peek-inside-amazon-go#page=1) coming from Amazon Go’s private-label brand, including ready-to-eat meals and snacks. This shift is promising, with [lunch combinations and refrigerated sandwiches](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2017/fresh-products-lend-to-convenience-stores-high-brand-equity.html) being the leading fresh categories that drive growth in the fuel & convenience space.

While this shift does require an upfront investment, it gives fuel & convenience retailers more brand equity in the long run. Adapting to changing consumer preferences with more diverse product offerings, especially branded ones, is a great way to build long-term loyalty and increase profits.

## New & Improved Data Access

Amazon has long been known for its dominance in ecommerce, particularly in managing and leveraging customer data. By entering the physical retail space across various endeavors, Amazon is now doing what many brands and retailers are furiously trying to figure out: bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds. To do so, retailers must make improvements to how data is accessed, particularly in the fuel & convenience space where antiquated hardware has made that a difficult task.

However, improved data access has become more available with newer platform technologies. Amazon’s focus on data should ignite all retailers to not only collect large amounts of data, but to also leverage it to improve the customer experience. If a customer is sharing their data with a retailer, they expect personalized messaging and offers in return. Access to data has been a priority for many retailers for quite some time and Amazon has only further increased the sense of urgency.

## The Urban Consumer

Most of the US lives in an urban area ([80.7% to be exact](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cities-population/more-americans-move-to-cities-in-past-decade-census-idUSL2E8EQ5AJ20120326)). Amazon’s new store format addresses the urban consumer in a number of ways, enabling customers to purchase items in-store and order items to be delivered within the same trip, and motivates customers who don’t own a car to visit a convenience store. Granted, there is not a fuel station attached to Amazon Go, but this new format changes consumers’ perceptions to associate purchases beyond just fuel with convenience stores.

As urban populations continue to rise, and public transit and ridesharing services continue to grow, fuel & convenience retailers must be prepared to drive customers to their businesses for reasons other than fuel. Factors like fresh food, a streamlined in-store experience and more personalized offers, can drive non-fuel customers to a convenience store versus a grocery store. 

While it’s not expected that anyone emulate Amazon Go’s concept tomorrow, there are a variety of lessons to be learned from their latest endeavor. Convenience retailers can prepare for the future by focusing on the customer first, understanding them better and serving a better overall experience.
