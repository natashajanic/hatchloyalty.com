Last month, we hosted an Executive Breakfast and Leadership Discussion to kick off a busy week at the NACS Show in Chicago. The discussion covered leading innovation in the retail sector, factors that affect customer expectations and the impact of digital on how consumers interact with retailers and brands. Our experienced panel featured moderator Kevin Phelan, current President of Agon Partners and former Chief Sales and Marketing Officer at BP North America. Panelists included Todd Lutwak, Partner at Andreessen Horowitz and former Vice President of Selling at eBay, and Kelly Mahoney, current Director of Strategy at Ulta Beauty and former Director of Consumer Engagement and Loyalty at BP.

We gathered many valuable insights throughout the hour-long discussion. Guests from Salesforce, SKUPOS, Murphy USA, Buy It Mobility Networks, Drop Tank, CARDFREE, Texor, SwiftIQ, P97, Conversant, Accenture, Pride Stores, GasBuddy, Eby-Brown, Wayne Oil Co., and more contributed to the question and answer portion of the event. Some of the main topics covered included: loyalty and engagement, personalization, data, and implementation.

## Engagement Is the Process. Loyalty Is the Outcome.

### *"In this industry, we think of loyalty as a tool or a program that incents a customer so you can buy their love..."*
-Kelly Mahoney

### But we believe loyalty is more than a discount.

Engagement and loyalty are typically used hand-in-hand, but often times, loyalty isn’t thought of through the appropriate lens. As described by Kelly Mahoney, “In this industry [fuel & convenience retail], we think of loyalty as a tool or a program that incents a customer so you can buy their love.” Loyalty isn’t something that can just be bought, but is nurtured over time through consistent and personalized engagement. While an incentive will get a customer to participate in a loyalty program, getting to know your customers on a more meaningful level is what builds brand loyalty because [loyalty is more than just cents off](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/blog/loyalty-cents-off/).

Many fuel and convenience retailers have focused on fuel-only rewards that give customers cents off fuel. While this has been an industry norm, with the rapid changes in customer preferences, the rise of digital, and changes in fuel consumption as a result of electric cars and ridesharing, fuel and convenience retailers must start focusing efforts beyond fuel. In order to effectively target customers, convenience retailers need to better understand their needs throughout the customer journey and address them at the right time, through the right channel.

Think of all the avenues through which you can engage with your customers: mobile, social media, in-store, in-app, digital advertising, the list goes on. Loyalty is the marketing vehicle that can get you to your customer the fastest and most effectively. It doesn’t end there. The customer journey is more than going from point A to point B. It can start at point C, speed toward point G, and then loop back around to point A. The customer journey is rarely linear, so the approach to loyalty and engagement shouldn’t be either.

Millennials and Generation Z expect retailers to know enough about them to anticipate their needs across these different points in their respective journeys. They will make decisions about who they do business with and who they give their loyalty to based on who does that really well.

**Who's Getting It Right?**

If you ask any marketer who they believe is the golden standard for loyalty, you’ll likely hear Starbucks more than once. Starbucks boasts more than [12 million loyalty members](https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2016/08/01/starbucks-holds-more-cash-than-many-banks-infographic/#5862d0e3231a) in the US alone and 41% of all customers in the US and Canada pay after loading money onto a Starbucks card. This endeavor has been so successful that Starbucks customers in the US have loaded more than $1.2 billion onto Starbucks cards and the mobile app. That’s more money than is held at some banks.

How did Starbucks do this? They anticipated customer needs. They understood that their customers were usually in a hurry when visiting their stores, but were fiercely loyal to the Starbucks brand. Rather than swipe a credit card to pay, Starbucks was able to incent repeat customer behavior by finding the lowest common denominator of payment: the gift card. By expanding payment into their mobile app, customers no longer even need their wallet to order a coffee. They’ve trained customer behavior to shop at Starbucks because of technology and the resulting convenience and personalization.

### *"My definition of a great loyalty program is a program that modifies customer behavior."*
-Todd Lutwak

While you don’t have to be the next Starbucks, thinking the way Starbucks does can lead to a successful engagement program: what do my customers want? How can I get to know my customers? How can I make their lives easier? “My definition of a great loyalty program is a program that modifies customer behavior,” said Todd Lutwak. One way to modify behavior is through personalization.

## The Personalization Expectation

“I think people want to be marketed to,” was one of the interesting points Todd Lutwak made during the panel discussion. Consumers don’t think of marketing as invasive, or even as marketing when it’s properly targeted. Customers are actually more open and inclined to modify behavior if it anticipates their needs. The digital world has increased customer expectations when it comes to personalization. In the past, buyer personas were all that many retailers needed. Was this customer a fuel only customer? Were they fuel + retail? With the digitization of the retail experience, personas now need to [shift to personalization](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/blog/from-personas-to-personalization-people-based-marketing/).

While retailers don’t need to know every detail about their customers, collecting customer data from a variety of sources and behaviors through an engagement program is a great way to get started. Retailers are already engaging in suggestive selling: “Get $1 off this new Coca-Cola flavor when you purchase fuel!” What if that customer is a loyal Pepsi drinker? The retailer has now not only missed out on an up-sell, but has also potentially disengaged that customer.

By layering a loyalty and engagement program over product recommendations, retailers are able to deliver suggestive selling in a more authentic way that feels personalized for the customer, [making the suggestion much more powerful](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/blog/personalizing-convenience-how-technology-is-transforming-the-fuel-convenience-store-industry/). Many people look to Amazon as the reigning expert on product recommendations. They’re able to suggest products based on past purchases, as well as “people who bought this item, also bought this other item,” which has proven to be extremely effective with [35% of Amazon’s revenue](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers) being generated by their recommendation engine. Interestingly enough, it’s just data. When that data and resulting recommendation is presented to the customer, however, it’s interpreted as personalization, which leads to long-term brand loyalty when maintained accurately and consistently.

## We Have the Data. Now What?

### *"This is a reality businesses need to face: all of your customers are not equal."*
-Todd Lutwak

Many retailers have access to massive amounts of transactional and customer data. The issue largely lies in having all data in one place and knowing what to do with it. Let’s say a convenience retailer is presented with 3 customers and is told to choose one customer to receive 100% of their business, but will lose the business of the other two. Right now, most retailers don’t have all of the data they’d need to make that decision. “This is a reality businesses need to face: all of your customers are not equal,” said Todd Lutwak about having the right amount of data to make customer engagement decisions.

Data becomes extremely important when tracking a customer throughout their lifecycle and gaining an understanding of what their needs and wants are across different touch points. When do they become dissatisfied? When do they churn? What can retailers do to prevent churn and when is the best time to do so? Anticipating customer needs and sentiment is part of effective engagement and personalization.

There has been a growing title in corporate America, which is “head of analytics” or sometimes called “head of growth.” These individuals have a thorough understanding of data and are typically heavily involved in major business decisions. While their role begins with data, it quickly develops into other areas of the business such as strategy, operations, marketing, etc. In convenience retail, a head of analytics would be able to look at transactional and behavioral customer data, and while understanding the business objectives set forth by leadership, will be able to determine what the retailer will need to do in order to move the needle this month, quarter, year, etc.

**"Data Takes You Down to Unintuitive Conclusions"**

It’s common to expect data to “make sense.” However, there will be many times that an analytics person will deliver an insight that doesn’t seem logical at the surface. One such example was discussed during our panel.

Think of Netflix when it first launched: they physically mailed DVDs to subscribers (we know, this seems like centuries ago). Assume Customer A gets 15 movies per month and Customer B gets 1 movie per month. Let’s say Customers A & B want the same movie on the same day. Who should Netflix send the movie to?

Many would instinctively answer Customer A. Netflix would determine they should send it to Customer B. Here’s why:

As a subscription-based service, Netflix will collect its $8 each month regardless of the number of movies someone ordered. Data suggests that Customer A is a heavy user and therefore, will just pick another movie if that particular one isn’t available. Customer B, on the other hand, may be so disappointed that the one movie they want to order this month is unavailable, they leave the platform completely. Netflix used their data to determine which customer was more likely to churn and gave that customer the movie instead.

## Implementation Doesn't Have to Be Complicated

Many retailers understand the importance of customer engagement to their business, but implementation is still the biggest challenge. Fortunately, the barrier to entry is the lowest it has ever been. In the past, only large companies with multi-million dollar tech initiatives had access to advanced technology platforms. In the convenience retail space, everyone looked to major oil to dissect the implementation process because it looked so difficult and expensive.

Today, with the rise of [cloud-based software](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/blog/how-open-architecture-and-apis-are-changing-convenience-retail/), retailers are able to access loyalty and customer engagement solutions that are not only more price effective, but more agile in their approach. By getting to market and gathering customer data quickly, retailers are able to determine what is and isn’t working for their business without spending large amounts of money and time.

### *"You're going to have to make changes as a corporation when you're incorporating customer engagement the right way because it doesn't belong to marketing, it doesn't really belong in technology, it's really a blend of the two that work together."*
-Kelly Mahoney

With changing how technology is implemented by opting for more developer-friendly options, retailers will have to re-think how they’re organized as a corporation. “You’re going to have to make changes as a corporation when you’re incorporating customer engagement the right way because it doesn’t belong in marketing, it doesn’t really belong in technology, it’s really a blend of the two that work together,” said Kelly Mahoney. The key is understanding that customer engagement and loyalty permeate all facets of your business and impact more than just your bottom line.

It is clear that many industries are changing rapidly for a number of reasons including changes in customer expectations, digital engagement, and access to data. Our panel of experts shed even more light to just how those changes will impact fuel and convenience retail.
