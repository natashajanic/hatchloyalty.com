CHICAGO, September 5, 2017 -- Hatch Loyalty, formerly Belly, has undergone a renaming that represents the evolution, growth and innovation of the company. Hatch’s simple and adaptable engagement platform enables retailers and brands of all sizes to build stronger relationships with their customers. Belly will continue to exist as Hatch’s loyalty solution for small- to medium-sized businesses.

“The primary driver was a recognition that Belly is a very important part of who we are, but isn’t representative of all we have to offer our customers and partners. We believe loyalty is an outcome of a great customer experience.  Our technology serves as the platform enabling personalization, with the aim of driving new, desired behavior on behalf of our retail and brand partners.  Our team has been expanding the Hatch platform capabilities, services and processes for about a year now, Hatch represents the culmination of that work on behalf of our employees and customers. We’re excited about the future,” said Hatch Loyalty CEO, Dan Gloede.

Hatch is grounded in the belief that customers are more than just transactions, they’re people. Retailers typically have access to customer data, but lack the ability to make those insights actionable. Hatch bridges the gap between technology that delivers insight, and technology that delivers marketing; allowing retailers to better understand their customers, and personalize the customer experience.

“Hatch has created a robust but easy-to-integrate customer loyalty platform that enables retailers to better understand and incentivize their customers.  Essentially, it's a loyalty-as-a-service offering that allows retailers to engage their customers and grow their sales in a meaningful way,” said Jeff Jordan, general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

With technology at its core, Hatch’s platform delivers the speed and flexibility retailers need to keep up with consumer demands. Its primary focus will be to bring more innovative technology to the fuel and convenience store industry and with technology partners.

“We’ve been working closely with Hatch as a trusted partner throughout the year, with great results. Their flexible platform technology makes it possible for us to deliver innovative consumer engagement products to fuel and convenience store retailers; enabling these retailers with best-in-class tools they’ve never had access to before,” said Dave VanWiggeren, CEO of Drop Tank, a fuel discounts rewards company.
