To our valued customers and partners,

Today we are announcing the renaming of our company to [Hatch Loyalty](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/).

There were many reasons for making this change.  However, the primary driver was a recognition that Belly is a very important part of who we are, but isn’t representative of all we have to offer our customers and partners.

We chose ‘Hatch Loyalty’ because we believe loyalty is an outcome of a great customer experience.  Hatch is the origin.  It’s the start of a relationship that will grow and change and endure.  And it’s how we approach innovation.  We crack things wide open.  We change and we evolve.

At our core, we design technology that builds and transforms relationships with your customers. This renaming allows us to create a brand around our mission, deliver the right solutions for a broader market of customers, and a platform to continuously improve our offerings for current and future customers.

The renaming also allows us to show the evolution and growth of our company.  When we started the company, we built products solely for independent retailers.  As we’ve grown, we’ve developed enhanced capabilities and tooling for large enterprise retailers and brands, including those in the convenience (c-store) and fuel space.  Over time, we’ll continue to grow and use our technology to address an even wider market of customers and partners.

Today, we’re announcing new platform products, [HatchHQ, HatchIQ, and HatchHUB](https://www.hatchloyalty.com/c-store/).  These products work together to provide our large retail and technology partner customers a valuable set of tools to build relationships and create powerful, unique customer experiences, driving new behavior and growing sales for retailers and brands.

We’re excited to share more about new products, services and partners over the upcoming months.

Your customers are more than just transactions, they’re people, and Hatch Loyalty is committed to making your business personal.

Regards,

Dan Gloede
CEO, Hatch Loyalty
