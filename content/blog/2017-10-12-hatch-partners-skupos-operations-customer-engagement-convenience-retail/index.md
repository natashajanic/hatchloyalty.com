CHICAGO, October 12, 2017 -- Hatch Loyalty, a consumer engagement platform, has partnered with SKUPOS, a leading Front-Office software platform for the convenience retail industry, to bring an innovative solution to the fuel and convenience store space.

Hatch focuses on helping retailers and brands better understand their customers and create more meaningful relationships through personalized experiences. SKUPOS enables convenience store retailers to streamline ordering and automate sales tracking using a lightweight software solution that sets up in less than 10 minutes. Together, the partnership will allow convenience retailers to automate offers to customers that account for both customer preferences as well as sales data.

“While we’ve primarily focused on improving store operations, we’ve wanted to augment our offerings with more ways for retailers to reach their customers. With Hatch’s platform, we’re able to give our clients two best-in-class solutions that connect operations management and sales insights to their marketing initiatives,” said Jake Bolling, Co-Founder and CEO of SKUPOS.

In addition to streamlining store operations, SKUPOS provides added value through their Scan Data Reporting program, which compensates retailers for providing SKU-level sales insights to major brands. Through the Hatch partnership, brands will now also be able to access customer data and provide more targeted offers, optimizing their marketing spend and providing ROI attribution.

“In the past, convenience retailers were so bogged down by operational challenges, they didn’t even have time to consider how valuable their data was. The partnership between Hatch and SKUPOS creates value for everyone, in a way that not only benefits the c-store owner, but also their customer,” said Jake Kiser, CRO of Hatch. “Convenience retailers can monetize their data, brands have access to customer data, and customers have a much better experience.”
