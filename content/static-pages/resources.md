## Consumer Behavior

### [Offers](/resource/offers)

The primary tool to encourage a desired change in consumer behavior. Offers are composed of five components:

- **[Earning Mechanism](/resource/offers/earning-mechanisms)**: The behavior that the marketing initiative promotes, as well as the incentive given to a member for engaging with it, e.g., the purchase of a specific product in exchange for points.
- **[Constraints](/resource/offers/constraints)**: Any pre-fulfillment actions or conditions that must be met in order for a member to engage with the Offer, e.g., "activating" the Offer.
- **[Audiences](/resource/offers/audiences)**: Any factors that dictate what subset of Memberships should be shown the Offer, e.g., that the Membership is in a required [custom segment](/resource/custom-segments).
- **[Limits](/resource/offers/limits)**: Any limits, either global or per-member, that fulfillment or engagement with the Offer must abide by, e.g., a limit of 4000 fulfillments total.
- **[Marketing Contents](/resource/offers/marketing-contents)**: The locale-specific marketing copy that is shown to a member in a mobile application or digital signage, e.g., the title and an image.

### [Rewards](/resource/rewards)

The tangible benefits that a member can purchse with their accumulated points. Rewards are composed of two components:

- **[Marketing Contents](/resource/rewards/marketing-contents)**: The locale-specific marketing copy that is shown to a member in a mobile application or digital signage, e.g., the title and an image.
- **[Segmentation](/resource/rewards/segmentation)**: The ability to target a subset of Memberships with a personalized Reward.
